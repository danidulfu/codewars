For a given nonempty string s find a minimum substring t and the maximum number k, such that the entire string s is equal to t repeated k times.

The input string consists of lowercase latin letters.

Your function should return :

a tuple (t, k) (in Python)
an array [t, k] (in Ruby and JavaScript)
in C, return k and write to the string t passed in parameter
Examples:
"ababab" ---> (t = "ab", k = 3)

"abcde" ---> (t = "abcde", k = 1)
because for this string, the minimum substring 't'
such that 's' is 'k' times 't', is 's' itself.
