So Easy: Price of Phone

Task
You work in a mobile phone store, your job is to determine the sales price of mobile phones. You need to ensure that at least 15% of the profit after each mobile phone is sold. For example: A phone's cost price is $100, its sales price should be $115.

An additional requirement: mobile phone sales price must be first rounded to an integer, then adjusted up so that the last digit is 5 or 0. For example: A phone's cost price is $120, after add profits 15%, the sales price should be $138, but the last digit is 8, so you need "ceil" it to $140.

You've got a list, it has the cost price of mobile phones that need to be sold:

iPhone 7 cost price: $800
Samsung note 7 cost price: $600
iPad pro cost price: $700
You need to generate a list of sales prices:

iPhone 7 sale price: $920
Samsung note 7 sale price: $690
iPad pro sale price: $805
