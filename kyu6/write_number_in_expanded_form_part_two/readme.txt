Write Number in Expanded Form - Part 2
This is version 2 of my 'Write Number in Exanded Form' Kata.

You will be given a number and you will need to return it as a string in expanded form :


For example:

807.304 --> "800 + 7 + 3/10 + 4/1000"
  1.24  --> "1 + 2/10 + 4/100"
  7.304 --> "7 + 3/10 + 4/1000"
  0.04  --> "4/100"
